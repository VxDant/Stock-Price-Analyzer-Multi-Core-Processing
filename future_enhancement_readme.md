# Stock Analysis Parallelization Enhancement Guide

## Current Implementation Overview
The current implementation (`parallel_stock_final.py`) includes basic parallelization for:
- Stock data fetching using ProcessPoolExecutor
- Basic Prophet forecasting in parallel processes

## Suggested Enhancements

### 1. Parallel Data Chunking and Processing
Enhance data processing by implementing chunk-based parallel processing for better memory management and performance.

```
def process_data_chunk(chunk):
    chunk['MA_50'] = chunk['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
    chunk['MA_200'] = chunk['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()
    chunk['Daily_Return'] = chunk['Close'].pct_change()
    chunk['Volatility'] = chunk['Daily_Return'].rolling(window=20).std()
    return chunk

def parallel_clean_data(df, chunk_size=1000):
    if df.empty:
        return df
    
    df.columns = [col[0] for col in df.columns]
    df.dropna(inplace=True)
    df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
    
    chunks = np.array_split(df, max(1, len(df) // chunk_size))
    
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=mp.cpu_count()) as executor:
        processed_chunks = list(executor.map(process_data_chunk, chunks))
    
    return pd.concat(processed_chunks)
```

### 2. Enhanced Parallel Data Fetching
Implement batch processing and retry mechanism for more reliable data fetching.

```
def fetch_stock_data(ticker, retries=3):
    for attempt in range(retries):
        try:
            df = yf.download(ticker, start='2015-01-01', end='2025-01-01')
            df.reset_index(inplace=True)
            return ticker, df
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == retries - 1:
                return ticker, pd.DataFrame()
            continue

def process_stock_batch(tickers_batch):
    return [fetch_stock_data(ticker) for ticker in tickers_batch]

def enhanced_parallel_data_fetch(tickers, batch_size=5):
    ticker_batches = [tickers[i:i + batch_size] for i in range(0, len(tickers), batch_size)]
    
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=mp.cpu_count()) as executor:
        batch_results = list(executor.map(process_stock_batch, ticker_batches))
    
    return [item for batch in batch_results for item in batch]
```

### 3. Parallel Technical Analysis
Add parallel computation of technical indicators.

```
def calculate_technical_indicators(data):
    # RSI calculation
    delta = data['Close'].diff()
    gain = (delta.where(delta > 0, 0)).rolling(window=14).mean()
    loss = (-delta.where(delta < 0, 0)).rolling(window=14).mean()
    rs = gain / loss
    data['RSI'] = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return data
```

### 4. Parallel Feature Engineering
Implement parallel feature engineering for date-based features.

```
def engineer_features(df):
    df['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year
    df['Month'] = df['Date'].dt.month
    df['Day'] = df['Date'].dt.day
    df['DayOfWeek'] = df['Date'].dt.dayofweek
    return df
```

### 5. Enhanced Parallel Forecasting
Improve forecasting by implementing parallel processing of data chunks.

```
def parallel_forecast(df_train):
    chunks = np.array_split(df_train, mp.cpu_count())
    
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=mp.cpu_count()) as executor:
        futures = []
        for chunk in chunks:
            futures.append(executor.submit(run_forecast, chunk))
        
        results = [future.result() for future in futures]
    
    combined_forecast = pd.concat([r[0] for r in results])
    return combined_forecast, results[0][1]
```
